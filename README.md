This is the source code and content for [strall.com](https://strall.com) — a personal portfolio and demo hub built using my open-source AWS infrastructure framework.

## 🛠️ Build Your Own Serverless Static Website

Want to create your own **serverless, HTTPS-enabled static website** on AWS?

This repo is designed as a starting point for anyone who owns a domain name and wants to deploy a clean, fast, and fully serverless website using the same tools and infrastructure behind [strall.com](https://strall.com).

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme and deployed to AWS using modular Terraform components from [`aws-iac`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-iac), configured with [`aws-config`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-config).

### ✅ Get Started

1. **Fork this repo**
2. Follow the [Getting Started Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md)
3. Add your own content (Markdown, images, custom pages)
4. Configure your domain (Route 53 or external)
5. Deploy using Terraform modules from [`aws-iac`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-iac)
6. Optional: use provided [scripts](./scripts) to install Hugo, GitHub CLI, and jq

## 📃 Usage and Cost

This infrastructure is designed to have low operational overhead. You’ll be paying for:

- A Route 53 hosted zone (~$0.50/month)
- Any data transfer out from CloudFront (~$0.085/GB after Free Tier)
- S3 storage and requests (minimal for most static sites)

Actual charges will depend on your usage and AWS region — including storage, bandwidth, request volume, and DNS charges.  
See [usage](https://strall.com/usage) for real-world examples from this deployment.
