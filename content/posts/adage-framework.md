### Traditional AWS Deployments Are Holding You Back

If you've worked with AWS long enough, you‚Äôve likely experienced these pain points:

- Manually updating Terraform every time a new environment or feature is needed
- Hardcoded infrastructure dependencies that make it difficult to scale
- Multiple teams needing access to Terraform, even if they only manage configurations
- Lack of auditability ‚Äî who changed what, and when?

The traditional way of managing AWS infrastructure forces DevOps teams into bottlenecks and makes scaling complex architectures painful.

#### There‚Äôs a better way: Configuration-Driven AWS Deployments.

### The Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Model

Instead of modifying Terraform every time something needs to be deployed, we separate **infrastructure development from deployment management**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Once, Deploy Anywhere

- Terraform engineers create reusable infrastructure components (VPC, Aurora DB, S3, Lambda, etc.)
- These components do not hardcode environment names or dependencies ‚Äî everything is resolved dynamically
- References between components are defined via nicknames, ensuring that dependencies are discovered dynamically rather than through static mappings

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Is Fully Controlled by a Config Repo

- A JSON-based config repo defines what gets deployed and where
- Non-technical teams can update the config repo to trigger deployments ‚Äî no Terraform needed
- Terraform fails if the config is missing, ensuring that only pre-approved components get deployed
- Every deployment is backed by Git, ensuring a clear, auditable history of changes and approvals

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Functions Are Developed & Deployed Separately

- Lambdas are independent of Terraform and can be built, tested, and deployed in isolation
- At runtime, they resolve dependencies dynamically using AWS Parameter Store
- This enables microservices and event-driven architectures without tight coupling

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Dependency Resolution Instead of Hardcoded References

- Each deployed component registers itself in AWS Parameter Store after Terraform execution
- Other components dynamically discover their dependencies at runtime ‚Äî no need for explicit cross-references in Terraform
- Nicknames provide a predictable lookup pattern
- Example: An RDS instance dynamically finds its VPC and subnets based on a nickname-driven lookup mechanism

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Scale & Evolve Architectures Using Config Updates

- Adding a new database, Lambda function, or microservice doesn‚Äôt require modifying Terraform
- Instead, teams update the config repo to define new deployments and connections
- This enables feature branches, parallel deployments, and sophisticated architectures ‚Äî all controlled via simple config updates

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Built-In Security and Auditability

- All deployments are controlled via Git, ensuring version-controlled, trackable changes
- Access to modify configurations can be tightly restricted through Git permissions and AWS IAM policies
- Rollback and recovery are simplified, as previous configurations can always be restored
- No unauthorized changes ‚Äî if it's not in Git, Terraform won't deploy it

### How It Works: Three Repositories Working Together

The **Adage** guide explains how to use the model:  üëâ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/adage)

This system is built around three Git repositories:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (`aws-iac`)**  üëâ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-iac)

2. **Configuration (`aws-config`)**  üëâ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-config)

3. **Lambda Functions (`aws-lambda`)**  üëâ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-lambda)

This separation ensures Terraform engineers focus on building, while configuration managers control deployments.

### Why This Model Is a Game-Changer

‚úÖ You only build infrastructure & application code once ‚Äî no Terraform edits for each deployment  
‚úÖ Deployment is fully controlled by config managers ‚Äî no Terraform or AWS knowledge required  
‚úÖ Lambdas are developed & tested in isolation  
‚úÖ Terraform only deploys what's explicitly defined in the config repo  
‚úÖ Engineers build, others deploy ‚Äî with no coupling  
‚úÖ Supports parallel deployments and feature branches  
‚úÖ New services can be deployed just by updating configs  
‚úÖ Auditability and rollback come for free via Git  
‚úÖ Security-first model ‚Äî no Git, no deploy

### Getting Started

Want to implement this model? Here‚Äôs what to do next:

1. Fork the [`aws-iac`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-iac), [`aws-config`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-config) and [`aws-lambda`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-lambda) repositories  
2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to sync the config repo with AWS Parameter Store  
3. Define IAM policies to restrict changes to `/iac/.../config` entries  
4. Deploy and test your first configuration-driven AWS environment!
