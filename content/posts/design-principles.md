![Adage: A Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Framework](/img/adage-system-diagram.png)

This article outlines the core design principles behind a configuration-driven approach to AWS infrastructure.

These principles are designed to support modularity, auditability, scalability, and low-friction deployment across environments. Together, they form a consistent model that separates infrastructure code, configuration, and runtime behaviorâ€”while keeping everything connected through predictable patterns.

If you're looking to implement infrastructure that supports dynamic environments, feature isolation, and clean service boundaries, these principles provide a framework for building systems that are both flexible and easy to manage.

---

### Why Design Principles Matter

Without a consistent set of principles, infrastructure can quickly become hard to scale, debug, or evolve. This approach is informed by real-world needsâ€”where teams must deliver quickly, isolate environments safely, and maintain visibility into what's deployed.

The following principles serve as a foundation for building systems that are modular, testable, and production-ready, without compromising control.

---

### Core Design Principles

#### Build Once, Deploy Anywhere

Terraform modules are reusable across environments and AWS accounts. They donâ€™t include hardcoded values. The same component can be deployed anywhere by providing configuration through AWS Parameter Store.

---

#### Configuration Is the Source of Truth

Only components defined in the [`aws-config`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-config) repository are eligible to be deployed. Terraform fails fast if configuration is missing. All changes to infrastructure flow through Git, enabling full visibility and auditability.

---

#### Immutable Infrastructure

Infrastructure is never patched in place. Instead, new versions are deployed side by side and swapped in by updating configuration (e.g., updating a runtime parameter to point to a new service version).

---

#### Dynamic Dependency Resolution

Services donâ€™t hardcode references to other services. Instead, they resolve dependencies using nicknames and AWS Parameter Store. This allows one service to refer to another dynamically, making replacements and updates seamless.

---

#### Separation of Concerns

Infrastructure code, configuration, and application logic are maintained in separate repositories:

- [`aws-iac`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-iac): Terraform modules  
- [`aws-config`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-config): Configuration (in JSON)  
- [`aws-lambda`](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-lambda): Application and microservices  

Each repo is testable and deployable independently.

---

#### Environment-Agnostic Modules

Terraform modules donâ€™t know what environment theyâ€™re in. Each module receives a nickname and retrieves its configuration from a path like:

```
/iac/<component>/<nickname>/config
```

It writes outputs to:

```
/iac/<component>/<nickname>/runtime
```

---

#### External System Referencing

Even systems not built within this infrastructure model can be referenced predictably. For example:

```
/external/databases/legacy-db/runtime
```

This enables integration with third-party services or legacy stacks using the same patterns.

---

#### Git as the Gatekeeper

Nothing is deployed unless itâ€™s defined in Git. All changes require review and approval, supporting clear separation of responsibilities, full history, and strong audit trails.

---

#### LocalStack-Compatible by Default

Terraform modules support both AWS and LocalStack. This allows local testing and iteration with near-zero cloud cost, while still supporting full production deployments.

---

#### Smart Runtime Caching

Systems may cache configuration data locally for performance. If a failure occurs (e.g., database connection error), the system re-checks AWS Parameter Store before failingâ€”enabling dynamic reconfiguration and fast cutover support.

For more technical details, see the [**Adage** Design Principles reference on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/adage/blob/main/design-principles/README.md).

---

### Real-World Applications

These principles are already enabling patterns like:

- Running multiple versions of a database in QA to support feature testing  
- Deploying services without needing to update consumers  
- Referencing external or legacy systems using a unified lookup strategy  
- Replacing infrastructure without modifying consumer logic

### Explore the Repos

The architecture is publicly available across these GitHub repositories

The **Adage** guide explains how to use the model:  ðŸ‘‰ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/adage)

This system is built around three Git repositories:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (`aws-iac`)**  ðŸ‘‰ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-iac)

2. **Configuration (`aws-config`)**  ðŸ‘‰ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-config)

3. **Lambda Functions (`aws-lambda`)**  ðŸ‘‰ [View on GitHub](https://github.com/usekarma/aws-lambda)

### What's Next?

Future work will include:

- Example architectures built from reusable components  
- AppConfig and EventBridge integration for live refresh  
- Tools for syncing configuration and validating environment state
