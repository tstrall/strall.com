## **Why Traditional AWS Deployments Are Holding You Back**

If you've worked with AWS long enough, you’ve likely experienced these pain points:
- **Manually updating Terraform every time a new environment or feature is needed.**
- **Hardcoded infrastructure dependencies** that make it difficult to scale.
- **Multiple teams needing access to Terraform, even if they only manage configurations.**
- **Lack of auditability**—who changed what, and when?

The traditional way of managing AWS infrastructure forces DevOps teams into bottlenecks and makes scaling complex architectures painful.

### **There’s a better way: Configuration-Driven AWS Deployments.**

---

## **🚀 The Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Model**

Instead of modifying Terraform every time something needs to be deployed, we separate **infrastructure development from deployment management**:

### **1️⃣ Build Once, Deploy Anywhere**
- Terraform engineers **create reusable infrastructure components** (VPC, Aurora DB, S3, Lambda, etc.).
- These components **do not hardcode environment names or dependencies**—everything is resolved dynamically.
- **References between components are defined via nicknames**, ensuring that dependencies are discovered dynamically rather than through static mappings.

### **2️⃣ Deployment Is Fully Controlled by a Config Repo**
- A **JSON-based config repo** defines what gets deployed and where.
- **Non-technical teams can update the config repo to trigger deployments**, without modifying Terraform.
- Terraform **fails if the config is missing**, ensuring that only **pre-approved components** get deployed.
- **Every deployment is backed by Git**, ensuring a clear, auditable history of changes and approvals.

### **3️⃣ Lambda Functions Are Developed & Deployed Separately**
- **Lambdas are independent** of Terraform, so they can be built, tested, and deployed in isolation.
- At runtime, they **resolve dependencies dynamically** using AWS Parameter Store.
- **This enables microservices and event-driven architectures** without tight coupling.

### **4️⃣ Dynamic Dependency Resolution Instead of Hardcoded References**
- Each deployed component **registers itself in AWS Parameter Store** after Terraform execution.
- Other components **dynamically discover their dependencies** at runtime—no need for explicit cross-references in Terraform.
- **Nicknames provide a predictable lookup pattern**, allowing services to resolve dependencies without needing to know infrastructure details.
- Example: An RDS instance dynamically finds its VPC and subnets based on a nickname-driven lookup mechanism.

### **5️⃣ Scale & Evolve Architectures Using Config Updates**
- Adding a new **database, Lambda function, or microservice** doesn’t require modifying Terraform.
- Instead, teams **update the config repo** to define new deployments and connections.
- This enables **feature branches, parallel deployments, and sophisticated architectures—all controlled via simple config updates.**

### **6️⃣ Built-In Security and Auditability**
- **All deployments are controlled via Git**, ensuring version-controlled, trackable changes.
- **Access to modify configurations can be tightly restricted** through Git permissions and AWS IAM policies.
- **Rollback and recovery are simplified**, as previous configurations can always be restored.
- **No unauthorized changes**—if it's not in Git, Terraform won't deploy it.

## **📂 How It Works: Three Repositories Working Together**

The **Deployment Guide (`aws-deployment-guide`)** contains documentation for how to use the model. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-deployment-guide)

Using this model requires **three Git repositories** that interact to create a fully managed AWS environment:

1️⃣ **Infrastructure as Code (`aws-iac`)** – Terraform-based AWS infrastructure components. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-iac)  
2️⃣ **Configuration (`aws-config`)** – JSON-based configurations that define what gets deployed. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-config)  
3️⃣ **Lambda Functions (`aws-lambda`)** – Independently developed microservices that follow the same dependency resolution strategy. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-lambda)  

This separation ensures **Terraform engineers focus on building, while configuration managers control deployments.**

## **🔥 Why This Model is a Game-Changer**

✅ **You Only Build Infrastructure & Application Code Once** – No need to modify Terraform for each deployment.  
✅ **Deployment Is Fully Controlled by Config Managers** – No Terraform or AWS knowledge required to manage environments.  
✅ **Lambdas Are Developed & Tested in Isolation** – They follow the same dependency lookup strategy but deploy separately.  
✅ **Prevents Unauthorized Deployments** – Terraform **only deploys what is explicitly defined in the config repo**.  
✅ **Decouples Infrastructure Development from Deployment Execution** – Engineers build the infrastructure, while non-technical teams control deployments.  
✅ **Supports Parallel Deployments & Feature Branches** – Multiple versions (**`main-db`, `main-db-a`, `main-db-b`**) can coexist dynamically.  
✅ **More Complex Architectures Can Be Built Just by Updating Configs** – No need to modify Terraform to deploy new services.  
✅ **Minimizes Risk & Maximizes Auditability** – Since **all deployments are defined in the config repo**, changes are easy to review and track.  
✅ **Security-First Deployment Model** – Every deployment is tied to **Git-based version control**, preventing unauthorized modifications.

## **🔧 Getting Started**
Want to implement this model? Here’s what to do next:

1️⃣ **Fork the `aws-iac`, `aws-config`, `aws-lambda`, and `aws-deployment-guide` repositories.**  
2️⃣ **Set up a CI/CD pipeline to sync the config repo with AWS Parameter Store.**  
3️⃣ **Define IAM policies** to restrict changes to **`/aws/.../config`** entries.  
4️⃣ **Deploy and test your first configuration-driven AWS environment!**

📢 **What do you think? Would this approach simplify your AWS deployments?**
