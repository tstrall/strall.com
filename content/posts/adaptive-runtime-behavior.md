Open source [**Adage: Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Framework**](https://github.com/tstrall/adage) wasn’t built as a machine learning platform — but it enables one. Because each deployed component exposes its **runtime state**, **dependencies**, and **configuration** via AWS Parameter Store, the system becomes:

- Observable  
- Configurable at runtime  
- Adaptable without redeployment

---

## What Is Adaptive Runtime Behavior?

In this context, it means infrastructure that responds to runtime conditions:

- Services that select behavior based on observed state
- Configuration that adjusts over time
- Decision logic that operates independently from deployment processes

---

## Why This Framework Supports It

### 1. Decoupled Runtime State

Every component stores its runtime info under a consistent path:

```
/iac/<component>/<nickname>/runtime
```

This makes it easy to:

- Query current system state
- Compare it to intended config
- Support external logic without needing to reapply Terraform

### 2. Configuration as Control Layer

Because infrastructure behavior is defined in JSON config, it’s possible to:

- Track and reason about changes
- Apply decisions dynamically
- Swap rule-based logic for model-based logic incrementally

Configuration can evolve independently of infrastructure modules.

### 3. External Decision Logic

Runtime and config data are both accessible without touching infrastructure code. This allows external systems to:

- Recommend or modify config
- Generate runtime adjustments
- Surface decisions to operators or apply them directly

This is compatible with both human-in-the-loop and automated workflows.

---

## Potential Use Cases

This approach makes it feasible to build systems like:

### Adaptive Routing
A service selects a database instance based on runtime latency metrics.

### Config-Aware Scheduling
A batch job sets its own concurrency based on historical job durations.

### Deployment Risk Checks
A plan validator compares proposed config changes against prior patterns and flags high-risk diffs.

### Traffic Control
Traffic shifting between two versions is based on observed success rates.

These patterns don’t require deep ML integration to be useful — they rely on accessible system data.

---

## Human Oversight Remains Central

The framework is compatible with ML-driven adaptation, but it doesn’t require it. Configuration stays in Git. Runtime logic can be monitored or paused. Operators remain in control.

This supports workflows such as:

- Training models offline using structured config + runtime + cost data
- Surfacing config recommendations as pull requests or UI prompts
- Gradually increasing automation as confidence grows

---

## Summary

This infrastructure model supports adaptation by design. It separates configuration from infrastructure, makes runtime behavior accessible, and provides clear integration points for automation.

> Systems that externalize configuration and expose runtime state are easier to reason about — and easier to evolve.
