## The Role of Entropy in Karma

When we say “entropy” in Karma, we mean it in the **information theory** sense:  
> The amount of uncertainty — or surprise — in a system’s state.

For Karma, the system is *everything we’re tracking in the normalized event stream*: jobs, steps, suppliers, file arrivals, API responses. Each has patterns — some highly regular, others more chaotic.

## Why Entropy Matters

Entropy tells you **how predictable a process is**:

- **Low entropy**: A supplier always responds within 90 seconds, a daily job always starts on time.  
- **High entropy**: Job start times drift, responses vary wildly, steps go missing.

Karma’s goal:  
- **Measure** predictability.  
- **Model** expected behavior.  
- **Act** when entropy spikes in ways that matter.

## Measuring Surprise

From an event stream in ClickHouse:

1. **Group by context** (e.g., `entity_id`, `step`).
2. Build a **distribution** of event timings or transitions.
3. Apply Shannon’s entropy formula:

```
H(X) = - Σ p(x) log₂ p(x)
```

Where:
- `X` = possible outcomes (latency buckets, next step choices, etc.).
- `p(x)` = probability of each outcome from historical data.

A high `H(X)` means outcomes are spread out (unpredictable); low `H(X)` means outcomes are concentrated (predictable).

## From Measurement to Action

Once we know the baseline entropy for each `(entity, step)`:

- **Monitor** for real-time deviations:
  - Latency entropy higher than normal → process slowing unpredictably.
  - Step transition entropy spikes → workflows becoming inconsistent.
- **Flag or act**:
  - Publish `entropy.deviation` events.
  - Suggest corrective actions (`notify_supplier`, `retry_step`).
  - Feed into automation pipelines.

## Entropy in the Karma Loop

Karma’s architecture already:
- Normalizes events.
- Stores them in ClickHouse for high-cardinality queries.
- Feeds optional GraphDB for sequence/state relationships.
- Routes actions as first-class events.

The entropy layer fits **between analysis and action**:

```
[ Events in ClickHouse ]
        │
   Entropy Calculation
        │
[ entropy.predicted / entropy.deviation ]
        │
    Actions Pipeline
```

## Why This is Different

Most monitoring systems:
- Alert on thresholds (CPU > 80%).
- Require static rules.

Karma’s entropy approach:
- Learns what “normal” looks like per entity/step.
- Detects change even if the absolute numbers are “in range.”
- Prioritizes by **information content** — the most *surprising* changes surface first.

## What’s Next

- **MVP**: Median/MAD-based expectations for latency + simple entropy measures.
- **Upgrade path**: Model sequences and timings jointly for richer entropy signals.
- **Final goal**: An autonomous layer that constantly minimizes system entropy — not by keeping everything rigid, but by keeping it *predictably reliable*.
