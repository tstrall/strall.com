# Ted’s Law of Karma
*The covariance structure of entropy streams reveals the shared fate of interdependent systems.*

---

## The Observation
Every subsystem carries uncertainty — in operations we measure it as entropy.  
When entropy streams across many subsystems are collected and their **covariance** is computed, something remarkable emerges:

- Most of the time, uncertainties wander independently.  
- Sometimes, entropies **align** — covariance spikes.  
- The largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix exposes a **shared mode of uncertainty**, a systemic “fate.”

---

## The Claim
This pattern is not confined to infrastructure. It is a universal principle:

> **Karma is the alignment of uncertainty.**  
> What traditions call “karma” — the ripple of actions across a system — is mathematically visible as the covariance of entropies.  
> In practice, it shows up as eigenmodes of risk.

## The Implications
- **For SREs:** Tracking λ₁ and logdetΣ across entropy streams yields early warnings before incidents manifest.  
- **For Complex Systems:** Eigenmodes of uncertainty describe how local noise amplifies into global cascades.  
- **For Philosophy:** Karma is not mystical bookkeeping — it is interdependence, written in the language of information.
