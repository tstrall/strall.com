## **Professional Summary**

**Cloud infrastructure engineer** with a focus on scalable system design, automated deployment pipelines, and secure AWS architecture. Creator of **Adage** and **Karma**, open-source frameworks for modular infrastructure and graph-based system tracking.

Experienced with **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, **Jenkins**, and modern AWS services including **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **Fargate**, **EKS**, **IAM**, **Cognito**, and **RDS**. Support developer workflows with CI/CD, observability, and secure, automated infra.

## **Experience**

### **Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer**  
**Sparksoft (via TISTA)** – Remote  
*Jul 2023 – Mar 2025*

Led multiple modernization efforts on the APS project, spanning data migration, infrastructure, and DevOps automation.

- Re-architected the **EKS** cluster lifecycle using **Terraform**, improving reliability and consistency across environments.
- Automated ingestion of structured/unstructured logs into **Splunk** for auditing and debugging distributed ETL pipelines.
- Integrated **Datadog** with AWS infrastructure (Lambda, EC2, RDS) to monitor performance metrics and set up custom alerts for critical services.
- Implemented secrets orchestration via **Secrets Manager**.
- Enhanced observability with custom **Grafana** dashboards.
- Took ownership of a complex **Oracle-to-Oracle data migration** involving 200+ interdependent SQL scripts tied to production workloads on **EKS**.
- Fully automated the 14-hour migration process into a single-command workflow, replacing manual **CI/CD** steps with a DevOps-standard deployment model.
- Worked closely with data scientists and the client to identify and resolve legacy **data quality** issues ahead of the migration.
- Took ownership of the post-migration data model and aligned it with CMS standards through direct collaboration with analysts, developers, and DBAs.
- Designed and automated a repeatable **Oracle RDS to Aurora PostgreSQL migration** framework using **Terraform**, **AWS SCT**, **DMS**, and **Git** workflows—enabling rapid conversion testing via **disposable environments**.
- Provided **hands-on support** during production incidents, root cause analysis (**RCA**) and issue remediation.
- Worked directly with non-technical stakeholders to surface blockers, clarify priorities, and drive delivery.


### **Senior Cloud Engineer**  
**TISTA Science and Technology** – Remote  
*Jun 2019 – Jul 2023*

Led AWS infrastructure delivery across multiple federal contracts, balancing strict security requirements with automation and scale.

- Designed and deployed production-grade infrastructure using Terraform, covering EKS clusters, serverless APIs, and multi-account architectures on both existing contracts and new proposals.
- Managed workloads using **EKS**, **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **S3**, **Aurora**, and **Route 53**,  ensuring uptime across dev, test, and prod environments.
- Defined **parameter-driven deployment pipelines** using **SSM**, **IAM**, and **Secrets Manager**, enabling secure environment separation and team handoff.
- Integrated **Cognito** for authentication in multiple applications with complex access control needs.
- Delivered repeatable bootstrapping tools and CI/CD patterns adopted across teams.
- Supported infrastructure under active development pressure, debugging Terraform drift, IAM failures, and rollout issues in real time.

### **Earlier Roles – Backend, DevOps, Data Engineering**  
**Examples: Bank of America, Uptake, Finch Computing, Bloomberg Law**  
*2008 – 2019*

Laid the foundation for my infrastructure work by owning backend systems, data pipelines, and deployment tooling across regulated and distributed environments.

- At Bank of America, built Prometheus monitoring system and long-term storage backend using HDFS to retain time-series metrics at scale.
- At Uptake, supported predictive analytics for industrial clients with Python-based data pipelines and real-time monitoring.
- At Finch Computing, developed pipelines and services for large-scale data ingestion, transformation, and machine learning. Supported streaming workloads and real-time analytics.
- At Bloomberg Law, rebuilt backend of Bloomberg Law’s legal search platform, migrating from legacy HP Autonomy to Apache Solr for improved relevance, scalability, and maintainability.

## **Open Source**

**strall.com / Adage Infrastructure Studio** – Lake Zurich, IL  

- Built [Adage](https://github.com/usekarma/adage), a Terraform-based framework for modular, multi-account AWS infrastructure with runtime-aware parameter management and identity-based access controls.
- Developing [Karma](https://github.com/usekarma/karma), a graph backend using Amazon Neptune for infrastructure lineage and dependency tracking across services and environments.

Both projects are used to prototype and document patterns I’ve developed through real-world cloud infrastructure work.
