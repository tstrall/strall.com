Hi, I’m **Ted Strall** — a software engineer, architect, and open-source builder focused on infrastructure automation, serverless systems, and configuration-driven deployments on AWS.

This site is both a personal portfolio and a working demo of the tools I’ve built to simplify AWS infrastructure at scale.

My goals with this project:

- Share a clean, low-cost template for building your own static site on AWS
- Demonstrate how config-driven deployments reduce friction and increase auditability
- Provide clear, open documentation of patterns that scale
