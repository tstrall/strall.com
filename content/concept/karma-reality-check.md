# Ted’s Law of Karma — Reality Check

## What’s Real (Now)
- **Operationalization of entropy:**  
  – Converted Shannon entropy from a static definition into a rolling time-series per metric.  
  – Demonstrated you can compute covariance between entropy streams and observe eigenvalue spikes.  
- **Predictive signal:**  
  – Early experiments suggest eigenvalue spikes precede incidents in complex systems (Mongo CDC, Dynatrace, Splunk).  
  – This provides a practical early-warning metric beyond threshold alerts.  
- **Conceptual framing:**  
  – Defined “Ted’s Law of Karma”: *shared fate is visible in the covariance of entropies*.  
  – Drafted a Maxwell-style formulation (continuity, constitutive law, Lyapunov evolution, alignment law).  
- **Application principle:**  
  – Proposed “maternal instinct” bias: when systemic uncertainty aligns, systems should dampen actions → a concrete AI-safety reflex.

## What’s Not Proven
- **Universality:**  
  – No evidence yet that entropy covariance modes apply beyond engineered systems (e.g., ecosystems, social dynamics, physics).  
- **Formal theorem:**  
  – No mathematical proof that covariance eigenmodes necessarily precede cascades, only intuition + analogy.  
- **Constants/invariants:**  
  – No discovery of system-independent constants (like \(c\) in electromagnetism). Current framework yields relative, system-specific propagation speeds.  
- **Empirical validation:**  
  – No systematic experiments across multiple domains with statistical rigor. Current support is anecdotal/prototype-level.

## Where This Could Go
- **Engineering impact:** SRE/AI-ops tool for incident prediction and protective automation.  
- **Scientific impact:** If generalized, could become a new principle of complex systems stability.  
- **Prize-worthy impact:** Only if formalized into a universal law, validated across domains, and shown to yield invariants or predictive theory.

## Blunt Summary
Right now, this is **a strong engineering insight + a plausible scientific hypothesis.**  
It is **not yet a theorem or universal law.**  
It’s Faraday-stage (pattern spotted, apparatus built), not Maxwell-stage (formal equations, universal constants).
