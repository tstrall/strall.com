# Mathematical sketch: Dimensionless, fractal governance

## 1) Canonical atoms and measures
- Let raw events from any source (logs, metrics, tickets, CDC, etc.) be mapped into a **canonical atom**:
  \[
  e=(a,o,v,m,t,c)
  \]
  actor \(a\), object \(o\), verb/type \(v\), magnitude \(m\) (possibly unitful), timestamp \(t\), context \(c\).
- A stream \(E=\{e_i\}\) induces **measures** over a graph \(G=(V,E_d)\) where \(V\) are entities and \(E_d\) are directed relations; measures are time-varying flows \(F_{uv}^v(t)\) (rate of type-\(v\) events on edge \(u\!\to\!v\)) and node intensities \(I_u^v(t)\).

## 2) Dimensionless normalization (Buckingham-style)
Pick characteristic scales from the data (not the domain):  
- time scale \(T_0\) (e.g., median inter-arrival),  
- magnitude scale \(M_0\) (e.g., robust median |m|),  
- population scale \(N_0\) (e.g., active nodes),  
- risk/impact scale \(A_0\) (allowed harm per unit time).

Define **dimensionless variables**:
\[
\tilde t=\frac{t}{T_0},\quad \tilde m=\frac{m}{M_0},\quad \tilde F=\frac{F}{M_0/T_0},\quad \tilde I=\frac{I}{M_0/T_0},\quad \tilde A=\frac{A}{A_0}.
\]
Everything downstream is computed in tildes. This is what makes the theory **dimensionless** and portable across domains.

## 3) Transformation group and invariants
Let \(\mathcal{T}\) be transformations that should not change “what the system *is*”:  
- unit re-scalings (already removed by tildes),  
- schema isomorphisms (renaming fields/types),  
- node relabelings (permutations of \(V\)),  
- **coarse-grainings** \(\mathcal{C}_\Delta\): merge time into windows of size \(\Delta\), optionally cluster nodes into super-nodes.

A **governance invariant** is any statistic \(J\) with
\[
J(\mathcal{T}(E))=J(E)\quad \text{and}\quad J(\mathcal{C}_\Delta(E))\approx J(E)\ \ \text{(within bounded distortion)}.
\]

Concrete, computable candidates (all dimensionless):
- **Response ratio** \(R=\frac{\Pr(\text{corrective} \mid \text{anomaly})}{\Pr(\text{incident} \mid \text{anomaly})}\).
- **Amplification index** \(A^\star=\frac{\text{avg downstream fan-out of anomaly edges}}{\text{avg baseline fan-out}}\).
- **Causal closure** \(C^\star=\) fraction of anomaly paths that terminate in a corrective action class within \(\tilde{\tau}\) time.  
- **Cycle entropy** \(H_\circlearrowleft=\) normalized entropy of cycle lengths in \(G\) weighted by \(\tilde F\) (captures feedback richness).
- **Assortativity by role** \(r^\star\) (role labels from \(v\) or \(c\)), revealing whether anomalies remain local vs. cross subsystems.

These are **schema-free** (dimensionless, label-invariant) and designed to be **scale-stable** under \(\mathcal{C}_\Delta\).

## 4) Fractal/RG (renormalization) picture
Define an RG operator \(\mathcal{R}_\Delta\) that maps parameter summaries at base resolution to summaries after coarse-graining by \(\Delta\):
\[
\theta'=\mathcal{R}_\Delta(\theta),\quad \theta=\{R, A^\star, C^\star, H_\circlearrowleft, r^\star,\ldots\}.
\]
A **fractal law** means there exist exponents \(\beta\) such that
\[
\theta' \approx \Delta^{\beta}\odot \theta \quad \text{(componentwise)},\qquad
\text{or fixed points }\theta^\ast\ \text{with}\ \mathcal{R}_\Delta(\theta^\ast)=\theta^\ast.
\]
Empirically: if \(R, A^\star, C^\star, H_\circlearrowleft, r^\star\) are stable (or follow power-laws) across \(\Delta\), your governance structure is **self-similar** (fractal).

## 5) “Maternal-instinct” bias as a control law
Let \(x(t)\) be a state vector of invariants (rolling estimates). Define a **dimensionless risk potential**
\[
\Phi(x)=\lambda_1(1-C^\star)+\lambda_2 A^\star+\lambda_3 H_\circlearrowleft-\lambda_4 R + \lambda_5(1-r^\star_{\text{healthy}})
\]
with \(\lambda_i>0\) chosen by policy. The **safe manifold** is \(\mathcal{S}=\{x:\Phi(x)\le \Phi_0\}\).

A generic **protective control** (“maternal instinct”) augments any operational policy \(\pi\) with:
\[
u_{\text{protect}}(t)=-K\,\nabla_x \Phi\big(x(t)\big)
\]
(i.e., act in the steepest direction that reduces potential). If \(\Phi\) is a Lyapunov-like function for the closed loop, trajectories are driven toward \(\mathcal{S}\) **at every scale**, preserving fractal structure.

## 6) Dimensionless “governance numbers” (like Reynolds)
With \(T_0,M_0,A_0\) defined from data, form unit-free ratios that predict regimes:

- **Stability Reynolds**:
\[
\mathrm{Re}_s=\frac{\text{throughput gain}\times A^\star}{\text{damping capacity}}
=\frac{\tilde F_{\text{anom}}\cdot A^\star}{\tilde F_{\text{protect}}}.
\]
Expect cascading failures when \(\mathrm{Re}_s>1\).

- **Governance Efficacy**:
\[
\Gamma=\frac{R\cdot C^\star}{A^\star}\quad (\uparrow \text{ is better})
\]
high when responses dominate incidents, closures are fast, and amplification is low.

- **Multi-scale consistency**:
\[
\kappa=\sup_{\Delta\in[\Delta_{\min},\Delta_{\max}]}\| \theta-\mathcal{R}_\Delta(\theta)\|_1
\]
small \(\kappa\) ⇒ invariants are **fractal-stable**.

## 7) What “dimensionless + fractal” buys you (testable claims)
1. **Universality**: If two systems have similar \(\theta\) (dimensionless invariants), they will respond similarly to shocks—even if the domains differ (tickets vs. logs).  
2. **Scale portability**: Policies tuned to \(\theta\) at one scale \(\Delta\) remain effective at other scales when \(\kappa\) is small (RG-stability).  
3. **Safety guarantee (sketch)**: If \(\Phi\) decreases along trajectories under \(u_{\text{protect}}\) and \(\mathrm{Re}_s<1\), the system remains in or returns to \(\mathcal{S}\).

## 8) Minimal PoC to ground this
- Ingest four sources (logs, metrics, tickets, CDC) → canonical atoms \(e\).  
- Estimate \(T_0,M_0,A_0\) from data; compute \(\theta\) and \(\Gamma,\mathrm{Re}_s,\kappa\).  
- Run **coarse-graining** for \(\Delta\in\{1,2,4,8,\ldots\}\) hours; verify RG stability (\(\kappa\) small) and power-law behavior.  
- Implement \(u_{\text{protect}}\) as an automated routing/throttling rule that steepest-descents \(\Phi\); observe whether \(\Gamma\uparrow\) and \(\mathrm{Re}_s\downarrow\) across scales.

This keeps your core insight **dimensionless** (unit-free, schema-free) and **fractal** (RG-stable across scales), while staying implementable: every quantity above can be computed from your Mongo→Kafka→CH fabric and evaluated in Grafana/CH queries.
