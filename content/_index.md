This site serves as a working demo of open source [**Adage:** A Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Framework](https://github.com/tstrall/adage) — built for flexibility, reuse, and minimal friction. It’s the same configuration-driven infrastructure I use to manage cloud projects and publish content with zero overhead.
