**Looking for HTTPS, CDN, and static hosting — all on the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)?**

If you already have a domain name, this project gives you everything you need to launch a fast, secure, serverless website — with minimal AWS cost and no monthly hosting fees. Just [fork the repo](https://github.com/tstrall/strall.com), follow the [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/tstrall/strall.com/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide, and you'll have your own HTTPS-enabled site deployed using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

Behind the scenes, this site also serves as a working demo of my open-source AWS automation framework — built for flexibility, reuse, and minimal friction. It’s the same [configuration-driven infrastructure](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-deployment-guide) I use to manage cloud projects and publish content with zero overhead.
