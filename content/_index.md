    This site is built entirely with reusable serverless
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> infrastructure.
  </span>
</p>

This site serves as a working demo of my [open-source AWS automation framework](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-deployment-guide) — built for flexibility, reuse, and minimal friction. It’s the same configuration-driven infrastructure I use to manage cloud projects and publish content with zero overhead.

**Looking for HTTPS, CDN, and static hosting — all on the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)?**

If you already have a domain name, this project gives you everything you need to launch a fast, secure, serverless website — with minimal AWS cost and no monthly hosting fees. Just [fork the repo](https://github.com/tstrall/strall.com), follow the [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/tstrall/strall.com/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide, and you'll have your own HTTPS-enabled site deployed using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
